Last year, I dove into the world of ergonomic keyboards, after experiencing pain and discomfort from typing long 
hours on my [Keychron K12](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k12-wireless-mechanical-keyboard). After a 
lot of research on the plethora of options out there, I went with the [ZSA Moonlander](https://zsa.io/moonlander).
It's an insane looking keyboard, but ZSA's website did a good job convincing me to give it a shot. It's a 
significant investment into a keyboard, but it's one I was willing to make given just how much time I spend at my 
computer and [ZSA's longevity claims for their keyboards](https://www.zsa.io/wireless).

So how's the experience of using a split keyboard? In a word, amazing. It wasn't easy, but I'm glad I made the 
switch. The first 2 weeks with the Moonlander were the worst part of the transition. For the first few months, I 
used both the Moonlander and my K12 on my desk just to maintain a reasonable level of productivity. ZSA offers 
tools to train yourself on their keyboards, and I spent a lot of time in their typing tests to get used to the 
Moonlander's feel. Here's a picture of my initial setup with the Moonlander (it's actually a newer photo where I'm 
using the Moonlander at a steeper angle using the tenting kit, but you get the idea).

I was WFH full-time back then, so I set a rule for myself: until I got comfortable using the Moonlander, I'd use a 
"normal" keyboard (the K12) when at work, and switch to the Moonlander when on my personal machine. This rule 
helped me immensely in gradually getting used to the Moonlander. I was free to experiment with different positions 
and angles for the keyboard, without affecting my work. It also allowed me to temporarily switch to the Moonlander 
whenever I felt discomfort from typing on the K12.

Over time, I was able to fully switch over to the Moonlander for my work too, allowing me to finally put the K12 
away. All this time, I was still using the default keyboard layout that came pre-configured with the Moonlander. 
But now that I was comfortable with the hardware, it was time to dive into the software.

One of the biggest selling points of the Moonlander is its configurability. ZSA provides a tool called the
[Oryx](https://zsa.io/oryx) that lets you change the layout of the keys on the keyboard (ZSA's keyboards use the 
QMK firmware, Oryx is just the UI layer for it). It's why I love my Moonlander, and where I feel I start to unlock its
full potential. As I mentioned earlier, for the first few months, I used the
[Moonlander's default layout](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/default/latest/0/). I also learned to touch 
type during this time, resulting in a much more comfortable typing experience along with improved posture.

## Switching to Colemak
Finally, it was time to look into alternate keyboard layouts. This particular rabbit hole goes **deep**! My 
research began with [popular alternatives to QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#Other_Latin-script_keyboard_layouts)
and what the pros and cons were for each one. Ultimately, I decided to try the [Colemak](https://colemak.com/) 
layout. The resources on their website helped me understand not only the rationale behind using Colemak, it also 
provided with resources on how I could implement it on my Moonlander. Since I was using the Moonlander exclusively, 
I decided to start slow and only change the letters, keeping the modifiers in their default locations. This still 
posed a real challenge, since I was undoing 2 decades of QWERTY. I printed out a screenshot of the Colemak layout 
and taped it to my monitor, so I wouldn't have to constantly look down.

And so went the next few months. At this point, I'd been using the Moonlander as my only keyboard for almost 6 
months. While my typing experience was considerably improved, I was still having to contort my hands in all sorts 
of ways to hit modifier keys. That was the next thing I addressed.

## Layers & Home Row Mods
So far, I'd intentionally kept things simple. Switching to the Moonlander has been an extremely 
high-risk high-reward strategy. However, once I got used to the base colemak layout, I decided to take the next 
step and delve into layers and home-row mods. For those unfamiliar with the concept of layers, when you press the 
Shift key on your keyboard, it goes into the CAPS and symbols layer. Mods on the other hand, is short for modifiers 
which are your Ctrl, Alt/Opt, Win/Cmd/Meta keys. Shift is also a modifier. Home-row mods means these modifier keys 
are on the keyboard's "home row", i.e. the middle row where your fingers would rest if you're touch typing. Oryx (and
by extension QMK/ZMK) allow for a number of layers on your keyboard which let you trigger specific letters, symbols,
numbers, Fn keys, and even macros. With that in mind, I set out to find a layout that I could use as a starting 
point. I learned about [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku), a 36-key layout based on a modified version
of colemak called [colemak mod-dh](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/), and [Seniply](https://stevep99.github.io/seniply/),
a 34-key layout again based on colemak mod-dh. I ran with both of these for about 2 weeks each, and decided to keep 
working with Seniply. It has a staggeringly low number of keys (only 34!), but I loved its implementation of home-row 
mods using [mod-tap](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/mod_tap.md) keys, and wanted to see how I 
could adapt to it.

## Current Layout
And that brings me to my current layout. As much as I love Seniply, I realized I needed my numbers on the first 
layer, next to my letters, along with easier access to my Fn keys. So with that in mind, I set out to create [my 
layout](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/ZRdvJ/latest/0).

This is the base layer. It's using colemak-dh for the letters, but the numbers are a variation on the dvorak layout.
I've also peppered in some useful shortcuts I access often. The Shift, Tab, Space, and Enter keys are on the thumbs,
with Delete and Backspace on both ends of the keyboard.

This is the "extend" layout. I borrowed the idea from miryoku and seniply and modified it a bit. The home row has 
modifiers on the left side and arrow keys on the right. I went with the "vim" layout as it's intuitive when navigating
code (which is where most of my arrow key usage happens). I also have the copy, paste, cut and undo shortcuts on this 
layer, so I can access them with no more than 2 key presses. This layer also has the Fn keys that follow the same 
layout as the numbers on the base layout, with F11 and F12 on the inner edge of each side.

And finally, I have the symbol layout. I spend most of my time working with .NET, React and React Native, so I've 
arranged the symbols such that they're easy to access. I'm not fully satisfied with this layer yet, so I'm watching 
my typing heatmap using ZSA's keymapp app to track which symbols I access the most often. I'll update the layout 
once I have enough data to make a decision.

## Conclusion

So after all that, how much did my typing experience actually improve? I'd say it's substantially better. The pain 
in my arms and wrists is gone, my posture's improved, and I can finally touch type without having to look at the 
keyboard. I'm so comfortable with this keyboard now that I've switched to blank keycaps. It's a fun conversation 
starter at the office now; people come up to me to introduce themselves and ask about the keyboard. ðŸ˜ƒ
