In 2022, I bought a Keychron K12, a mechanical keyboard with a 60% layout. While it wasn't my first 
mechanical keyboard (that honour goes to the Unicomp Model M), it was my first experience with such a small layout. 
At that point, the smallest I'd gone was an 80% layout, so it was a very frustrating experience initially. The 
first few weeks were especially bad. With no dedicated arrow keys or function row, I found myself constantly 
hunting for the layer switch keys. The concept of layers took me a while to adjust to, but I slowly got accustomed 
to them.
